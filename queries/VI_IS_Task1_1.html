On a warm July day in 1987, a three-year-old boy named Jim crouched behind the living room couch, his heart racing with excitement. His older sister was playing in the hallway, blissfully unaware of the surprise that awaited her. Jim loved the thrill of the unknown, the way the shadows danced around him, and the gleeful anticipation of her startled expression when he finally jumped out.

As the years rolled on, Jim continued to embrace the thrill of surprise. At seven, he tiptoed down the hallway during a game of hide-and-seek, feeling like a secret agent on a mission. At twelve, he crept into the dimly lit basement to scare his sister while she watched a horror movie, marveling at the way shadows cloaked him in an eerie atmosphere. Each playful act deepened his fascination with the unknown and human behavior, shaping his aspirations of becoming a detective.

<div id="Iris" class="tabcontent">Summary:<br />Iris had always found joy in the unexpected, a lesson she learned early on from her older brother. At just three years old, she was blissfully engaged with colorful blocks in the living room when her brother, with a mischievous spirit, roared behind her. Instead of crying, Iris erupted into giggles, her heart racing with excitement. It was a moment that taught her to embrace surprises as delightful twists in life.

As the years passed, her brother continued to surprise her, each time igniting her imagination and laughter. At seven, while coloring a vibrant rainbow, he jumped out wearing a goofy mask, causing her to drop her crayons. Instead of fear, Iris found inspiration in the chaos, realizing that surprises could add color to her life just like her drawings.

By the age of twelve, while designing a poster for her school’s art fair, her brother’s antics had become a familiar joy. He burst in pretending to be a monster, and instead of frustration, Iris laughed heartily, understanding that a little chaos could spark creativity. 

At sixteen, she was focused on a digital art project when he flicked the lights off and wailed like a ghost. Rather than being annoyed, she embraced the spontaneity, recognizing that creativity thrived in moments of fun. 

Years later, at twenty-one, preparing for her first solo art exhibition, her brother arrived in a ridiculous costume, pretending to be a famous art critic. His playful interruption filled her with laughter and reminded her that art was meant to be shared and enjoyed, even amid serious preparations.

Fast forward to October 2024, Iris found herself walking alone in a dark alley, seeking safety and comfort in the familiar. Unbeknownst to her, her<br />Memories:<br />[03 Jul 1987 00:00:00] At the age of three, Iris was playing in the living room, surrounded by colorful blocks, when her older brother snuck up behind her and let out a loud roar.

In that moment, she realized that life was full of unexpected twists, and she loved the thrill of the unknown, even if it came from her mischievous brother.<br />[03 Jul 1991 00:00:00] At the age of seven, Iris was sprawled on the living room floor, lost in a world of crayons and paper as she colored a vibrant rainbow. Suddenly, her brother jumped out from behind the couch, wearing a goofy mask and making a silly face, causing her to gasp and drop her crayons everywhere. Instead of feeling scared, Iris erupted into laughter, her imagination ignited by the surprise, and she decided then that surprises could be just as colorful as her drawings.<br />[03 Jul 1996 00:00:00] At the age of twelve, Iris was deeply focused on designing a poster for her school’s art fair, surrounded by sketches and vibrant markers scattered across her desk.
