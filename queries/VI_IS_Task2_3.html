With each checkmark, he felt a swell of satisfaction, realizing that even in the midst of disorder, his knack for structure was a source of accomplishment.

Years later, at sixteen, Alex joined a volunteer group dedicated to helping families in need. On a particularly busy day, he took charge, organizing his team and assigning tasks to ensure everything ran smoothly. As they loaded the van, he felt a profound sense of pride, recognizing that his ability to lead not only eased the burden for others but also ignited his passion for logistics and teamwork.
