<div id="Monica" class="tabcontent">Summary:<br />Monica had always been a sensitive soul, acutely aware of the delicate threads that wove her relationships together. As a child, she would stand on her tiptoes to peer through the living room window, watching her mother laugh with a friend, feeling a pang of confusion and unease at the thought of sharing her mother’s attention. That early lesson in connection and fear of loss set the stage for her future.

At seven, Monica sat cross-legged on her classroom floor, meticulously arranging colorful blocks. The laughter of her classmates filled the air, but her heart sank when she saw her best friend, Rachel, giggling with a newcomer. Jealousy flickered within her, a confusing emotion that whispered of the fragility of friendships. As she grew older, those feelings only intensified. At twelve, she found herself on the sidelines of the playground, sketchbook in hand, feeling left out as Rachel shared secrets with a boy. The ache of being left behind became a familiar companion.

By sixteen, Monica had transitioned from childhood games to the complexities of teenage life. In a bustling café, she felt a jolt of confusion when she saw Rachel smiling at a boy across the room. The bond they once shared felt precarious, and Monica grappled with the fear that her dreams of creating unforgettable experiences might come at the cost of losing Rachel&#x27;s closeness.

As she approached her twenties, Monica was determined to carve out her future. At twenty-one, while organizing her planner at a trendy restaurant, she noticed Rachel laughing with a handsome stranger. A wave of unease washed over her as she realized that her focus on work and aspirations might be pulling her away from the friendships that anchored her.

Fast forward to October 2024,<br />Memories:<br />[03 Jul 1987 00:00:00] At the age of 3, Monica stood on her tiptoes, peering through the living room window as she watched her mother laugh and chat with a friend, completely engrossed in their conversation. She felt a pang of confusion when she noticed her mother’s friend holding hands with someone Monica had never seen before, a feeling of unease settling in her small chest as she wondered if that meant she would have to share her mother&#x27;s attention. Even then, Monica sensed the importance of connections and the fear of losing the closeness she cherished, a feeling that would echo throughout her life.<br />[03 Jul 1991 00:00:00] At the age of 7, Monica sat cross-legged on the floor of her classroom, carefully arranging the colorful blocks into a perfect tower while her classmates giggled and played around her. She felt a flicker of jealousy when she noticed her best friend, Rachel, laughing with a new girl who had just moved to town, sharing secrets that Monica had once thought were just for them. In that moment, Monica&#x27;s heart sank as she grappled with the fear of being left out, realizing that friendships could shift and change in ways she didn’t yet understand.<br />[03 Jul 1996 00:00:00] At the age of 12, Monica sat on the sidelines of the school playground, clutching her notebook filled with sketches of party ideas and event layouts while her friends played tag in the distance. She felt a sharp pang of disappointment when she spotted Rachel giggling with a boy she had never seen before, their laughter echoing in the air like a secret she wasn’t a part of. In that moment, Monica&#x27;s heart ached with the realization that as friendships blossomed into new connections, she feared being left behind, her carefully curated world feeling just a little more fragile.<br />[03 Jul 2000 00:00:00] At the age of 16, Monica sat in the corner of the bustling café, her sketchbook open before her, filled with ideas for her upcoming birthday party, while her friends chatted animatedly around her. She felt a sudden jolt of confusion when she caught sight of Rachel across the room, sharing a warm smile with a boy who seemed to effortlessly draw her attention away from their usual group.
