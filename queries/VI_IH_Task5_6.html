Sarah Thompson had always believed in the power of communication. As a mother, she yearned for her son, Luke, to express himself openly. From the moment he was three, she knelt beside him while he played with colorful building blocks, hoping for a glimpse into his thoughts. But Luke merely shrugged, continuing to stack without a word. Concern crept into her heart; she wanted nothing more than to connect with him.

Years passed, and as Luke grew, Sarah&#x27;s desire for clear communication only deepened. When he was seven, she sat at the kitchen table, heart racing as she asked him about his birthday wishes. Luke fidgeted with his cereal, mumbling that he liked everything. Frustration bubbled within her; she longed for him to articulate his desires, believing that clarity would strengthen their bond.

At twelve, Sarah perched on the edge of Luke’s bed, gently probing about his feelings regarding the upcoming school dance. She searched his face for clarity, but he shrugged and mumbled indifferently. Disappointment washed over her; she felt the weight of adolescence pressing down, and she wanted him to open up.

By sixteen, Sarah leaned against the kitchen counter, heavy-hearted as she inquired about his summer plans. Luke avoided her gaze, offering only a vague mumble about hanging out with friends. The growing gap between them seemed insurmountable, and she wished for him to be open and honest.

When Luke turned twenty-one, Sarah sat across from him at a cozy café, hoping for insight into his career aspirations after graduation. She studied his expression, but he hesitated, mumbling about needing more time to figure it out.
