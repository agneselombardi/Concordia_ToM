<div id="Brian" class="tabcontent">Summary:<br />Brian had always been a helper, a trait that blossomed from a young age. At just three years old, he watched his parents struggle to lift a heavy box onto a shelf. With a determined little push, he eagerly joined in, earning smiles and laughter that filled the room with warmth. As he grew, so did his desire to assist, whether it was matching socks at seven, helping his father fix a leaky faucet at twelve, or chopping vegetables for a family gathering at sixteen. Each moment strengthened the bonds with his family and instilled in him a deep sense of fulfillment.

Years passed, and Brian found himself at college, where he honed not only his academic skills but also his knack for home repairs. After his first year, he returned home for the summer, greeted with joy by his parents. However, his father insisted he do some weekly chores to “earn his keep.” Though Brian would have preferred to relax, he understood the importance of helping out, especially since the house had fallen into disarray during his absence.
