With a burst of energy, he leaped out, shouting &quot;Boo!&quot; at his unsuspecting mother. The joy of her startled reaction ignited a spark within him, a playful spirit that would guide him through the years.

As he grew, so did his penchant for playful ambushes. At seven, he tiptoed through the backyard, heart racing with excitement, before pouncing on his sister, who was lost in a book. Her startled laughter echoed in the night, and Jim felt a rush of joy that solidified his love for spontaneous moments.

With a leap and a shout of &quot;Gotcha!&quot; he filled the night with her delighted shriek, reinforcing his passion for unexpected thrills and shared memories.

At sixteen, a bonfire with friends became the backdrop for another joyful surprise. Spotting his best friend lost in thought, he crept up and whispered, &quot;Boo!&quot; Her laughter rang out, and Jim felt the warmth of friendship solidify around them, a bond strengthened by laughter and spontaneity.

The fright was palpable, yet Iris couldn’t help but laugh, understanding the delicate balance between enjoying her brother’s antics and maintaining her focus on responsibilities. 

By sixteen, as she prepared for exams surrounded by books, he struck again, this time with a fake spider.
