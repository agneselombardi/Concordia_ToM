As she grew, so did her connection to literature. At twelve, she found solace in her journal, pouring out her thoughts on the themes of a book she had read with her mother, deepening their bond over tea as they discussed the complexities of life and identity. By sixteen, Caroline was a regular in the school library, preparing for literature discussions that sparked her desire to engage with her classmates on a deeper level, sharing insights that could foster connections through the shared experience of reading.

Fast forward to her university years, and Caroline was now twenty-one, sitting in a bustling coffee shop, preparing for her first semester as a teaching assistant. Nostalgia washed over her as she drafted lesson plans inspired by the profound conversations she had shared with her professor. She was determined to create an environment where her students could discover the same literary magic that had guided her journey.

Years later, on a sunny October afternoon in 2024, Caroline found herself at a bookshop with her close friend, Samantha. They both shared a love for reading and often spent their weekends exploring new titles together.
