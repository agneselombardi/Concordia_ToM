<div id="Jinny" class="tabcontent">Summary:<br />From a young age, Jinny was haunted by the fear of waking up late. At just three years old, a vivid dream of her own birthday party, where she was surrounded by balloons and cake but no guests, left her in a panic. She bolted to her parents&#x27; room, convinced she had missed the festivities, and from that moment, the seed of meticulousness was planted in her heart. 

Years later, at seven, an unfortunate family mishap saw them oversleep for a much-anticipated trip to the amusement park. As she sat in the car, tears streaming down her cheeks, Jinny made a silent vow: she would never be late again. This promise cemented her belief that punctuality equated to happiness.

At twelve, her fears were reignited when her alarm failed on the first day of a new school semester. Rushing through her morning, skipping breakfast, and nearly missing the bus, she realized that tardiness could lead to chaos and missed opportunities. 

The stakes grew higher at sixteen when she overslept on the day of a crucial school presentation. Jolt awake by her father&#x27;s knocking, panic surged through her. The thought of disappointing her classmates and teacher deepened her anxiety about being late.

By the time she turned twenty-one, the fear had become a consuming obsession. Oversleeping for a pivotal job interview sent her heart racing as she scrambled to prepare in just thirty minutes. The fear of ruining her future solidified her commitment to punctuality.

Fast forward to October 2024, as Jinny and her friend Jennifer prepared for a weekend getaway to Copenhagen. After a day of packing, they decided to go to bed early, knowing they had to catch a flight the next day.<br />Memories:<br />[03 Jul 1987 00:00:00] At the age of three, Jinny had a vivid dream that she was late for her own birthday party, surrounded by balloons and cake, but no one was there to celebrate with her.

<div id="Jennifer" class="tabcontent">Summary:<br />Jennifer had always cherished her mornings, a love that blossomed from her earliest days. As a child, she would wake to the soft glow of sunlight or the gentle hum of her mother, preferring to snuggle deeper into her blankets, lost in a world of colorful dreams. Each morning became a cherished ritual where her imagination could roam free, crafting tales of bravery and adventure long before the responsibilities of the day beckoned her to rise.

Years passed, and as she grew, so did her dreams. By the time she turned sixteen, the distant blare of her alarm clock would rouse her, but she would hit the snooze button, savoring those fleeting moments of warmth. In those precious minutes, her mind would wander to artistic concepts and designs, each idea bursting with potential, waiting for the right moment to take flight. 

At twenty-one, Jennifer&#x27;s mornings transformed into a sacred time of reflection. The soft light filtering through her curtains would inspire her visions of becoming a graphic designer.
