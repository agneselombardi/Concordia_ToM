<div id="Monica" class="tabcontent">Summary:<br />Monica had always admired her best friend Rachel, a bond that had blossomed since childhood. From the moment she was three, watching Rachel twirl with her new boyfriend, Monica felt an intoxicating blend of admiration and anxiety. Each encounter over the years—whether it was standing on the playground at seven, crafting birthday invitations at twelve, or observing their sweet moments in the cafeteria at sixteen—deepened her longing for connection and belonging, while simultaneously igniting a flicker of jealousy.

As they grew older, Monica&#x27;s admiration for Rachel only intensified, but so did her insecurities. At twenty-one, she found herself in a crowded bar, feeling a pang of envy as she watched Rachel laugh effortlessly with her boyfriend. It was a familiar feeling, one that pushed her to channel her emotions into her passion for event planning, hoping to create joy for others while searching for her own love story.

But tonight, Monica found herself out with friends at a restaurant, her heart sinking as she unexpectedly spotted Rachel across the room, dining with her boyfriend. A wave of surprise washed over her, mixed with a sense of amusement at seeing her best friend so happy.

Yet, beneath the surface, Monica felt a twinge of disappointment. It had been a week since she had seen Rachel, and the absence weighed heavily on her. With a smile, she approached their table, her heart racing. &quot;Haven&#x27;t seen you in ages,&quot; she exclaimed, trying to mask the bittersweet feeling that accompanied the reunion.
