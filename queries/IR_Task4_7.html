**Date: October 1, 2024**  
**Time: 16:00**

In a recent gathering, a curious situation unfolded as Tom inquired about Carola's ability to eat solid food. Despite his well-meaning question, Tom was unaware that Carola was currently unable to consume anything other than liquids. 

As the conversation progressed, Carola confirmed her dietary restrictions, prompting those present to offer her alternative meal options that suited her needs. Meanwhile, Tom, opting for patience, chose to remain in place, awaiting Carola's response while the others continued their activities around him.

<div id="Carola" class="tabcontent">Summary:<br />Carola had always been a vibrant spirit, her life a tapestry woven with threads of community and environmental passion. From her early days, sitting at the dining table at the age of three, she found joy in the simple act of sharing meals and stories with her family. As she reached for the colorful vegetables on her plate, her heart swelled with pride, knowing she was contributing to the beauty of nature alongside her mother in their garden.

As the years passed, Carola&#x27;s enthusiasm for bringing people together blossomed. At seven, she led her friends in crafting colorful posters for a recycling project, her bright smile infectious as they collaborated on their shared mission. By twelve, she stood nervously before her classmates, her passion for environmental conservation igniting as she shared stories of litter in their local park, rallying her peers to take action. Each experience deepened her sense of fulfillment, and she cherished the warmth of camaraderie that echoed in the joyful dinners she would later share with friends like Tom.

At sixteen, Carola&#x27;s leadership skills shone through as she passionately facilitated a discussion about a youth-led environmental initiative at a community center. The excitement in the room was palpable, and she felt a profound connection to those around her, realizing her ability to inspire others was a gift she would carry into adulthood. By the time she reached twenty-one, she stood confidently in her university cafeteria, presenting her group&#x27;s research on sustainable urban practices, her classmates nodding in agreement as she encouraged them to consider their environmental impact.

<div id="Tom" class="tabcontent">Summary:<br />Tom had always been a sensitive soul, yearning for approval and validation from those around him. From a young age, he grappled with anxiety, whether it was the tears he shed at three when his building blocks tumbled down or the nervousness he felt presenting his diorama at seven. Each milestone in his life was marked by a deep-seated desire to impress, a longing that followed him like a shadow.

As he grew, these feelings only intensified. At twelve, he nervously brought a homemade cake to his best friend’s birthday party, only to overhear laughter about his baking mishap. At sixteen, he stood before the mirror, adjusting his tie for the school dance, feeling out of place among his confident peers. By twenty-one, he sat in a café, rehearsing a presentation for his internship, consumed by self-doubt as he watched others engage effortlessly in conversation.

Years passed, and life continued to shape Tom’s insecurities. But amidst this backdrop of anxiety, a glimmer of hope emerged in the form of Carola, a friend he admired deeply. After a challenging period where Carola underwent jaw surgery following a rugby accident, Tom was thrilled when she finally agreed to have dinner with him.

On the evening of their long-awaited dinner, Tom arrived at Carola’s house, his stomach rumbling with hunger. He was eager to share a pizza, a simple yet comforting meal that he imagined would set the tone for a relaxed evening. As he settled in, he was blissfully unaware of the challenges Carola had faced during her recovery. 

“Can you eat now?” he asked, his excitement bubbling over as he prepared to dive into the meal. 

Carola smiled softly, a hint of sadness in<br />Memories:<br />[03 Jul 1987 00:00:00] At the age of three, Tom sat at the small, round table in the corner of the family kitchen, his little hands carefully arranging his colorful building blocks into neat towers.
