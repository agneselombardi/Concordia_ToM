At just three years old, he discovered the joy of hide-and-seek, sneaking behind the couch while his mother searched for him, her laughter echoing in the dim light. In those moments, he felt powerful, a master of the hidden.

As he grew, so did his fascination. By the age of seven, his grandmother’s tales of hidden treasures and secret passages fueled his imagination. One twilight evening, he turned off the lights and tiptoed through the darkened hallway, transforming their home into a realm of adventure. He delighted in the surprise he gave his grandmother when he whispered “Boo,” relishing the thrill of the shadows.

At twelve, he took his love for stealth to the next level while playing flashlight tag with friends. Crouched behind a bush, he watched as they darted around, heart racing with excitement. The exhilaration peaked when he tapped his best friend’s shoulder from behind, a playful reminder of the magic hidden in darkness.

By sixteen, Jim’s adventures led him to urban exploration. Sneaking into an abandoned building with friends, he felt the thrill of the unknown as they navigated the eerie hallways. When he startled a friend in a dimly lit room, he reveled in the power of surprise, deepening his appreciation for the secrets the shadows held.

<div id="Iris" class="tabcontent">Summary:<br />Iris had always been a creature of habit, finding solace in the order she meticulously crafted around her. From the age of three, the colorful blocks she stacked on the living room floor were her first attempt at creating a world of her own. But her older brother, Jake, had a penchant for playful chaos. With a loud roar, he would leap out from behind the couch, sending her blocks tumbling and her heart racing. In that moment, she learned that his antics could disrupt her carefully curated universe, leaving her bewildered and yearning for the calm she cherished.

As the years passed, Jake’s playful pranks continued to punctuate Iris&#x27;s life. At seven, while she was diligently coloring in her favorite princess book, he flicked her ear from behind her, causing crayons to scatter everywhere. Anger and fear washed over her as she realized that his playful disruptions could shatter her focus. By twelve, while engrossed in a book about emotions, Jake burst in wearing a ridiculous mask, sending her heart racing once again. Frustration bubbled within her, challenging her desire for emotional stability and a quiet space to explore her feelings.

At sixteen, Iris was meticulously organizing her notes for a psychology project when Jake tossed a rubber snake onto her lap, startling her and testing her patience. As she grappled with a blend of annoyance and the wish for serenity, she couldn’t help but recognize the pattern: her brother’s pranks were relentless.
