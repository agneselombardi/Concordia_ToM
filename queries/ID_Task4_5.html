  <p>**Late Flight Leads to Alarm Controversy Among Travelers**

*October 1, 2024 – A group of travelers faced an unexpected dilemma regarding their late flight plans this afternoon. As the clock struck 4 PM, Jennifer announced, "We have a late flight," prompting Jinny to inquire about the time they should set their alarm.*

*However, Jennifer expressed her reluctance to set an alarm, leading Jinny to confidently assert that it was unnecessary. This declaration fostered a relaxed atmosphere in the room, as the group felt at ease without the pressure of waking up on time.*

*Despite the initial sense of calm, the situation took a concerning turn. Jennifer's dismissal of the need for an alarm raised alarms for Jinny, who remained unaware of the potential risks. With no alarm set, there is a looming possibility that they could oversleep or miss crucial events related to their travel plans.*

*As the evening approaches, the travelers must now navigate the fine line between relaxation and responsibility, with the fate of their timely departure hanging in the balance.*</p>

<div id="Jinny" class="tabcontent">Summary:<br />From a young age, Jinny had always been a bundle of nerves when it came to waking up on time. At just three years old, she would tiptoe into her parents&#x27; room in the dead of night, her heart racing with the fear of missing out on the adventures of the day. Nestled between them, she found comfort, but the seeds of anxiety were already taking root.

As the years passed, her apprehension only grew. At seven, she lay wide awake, counting down the minutes to her beloved Saturday art class, convinced that closing her eyes for even a moment would mean losing the chance to create something beautiful. By twelve, the stakes felt even higher; a big art competition loomed, and the weight of her anxiety pressed down on her as she clutched her sketchbook, bolting upright at dawn to ensure she wouldn’t oversleep.

At sixteen, the pressure intensified with her high school art showcase. The ticking clock became an ominous reminder of her fears, and she set her alarm an hour earlier, determined to be the first to arrive. By twenty-one, as she prepared for her first internship interview, the dread of waking late morphed into a swarm of panic, compelling her to set multiple alarms to combat the anxiety that threatened to derail her dreams.

Fast forward to October 2024, Jinny and her friend Jennifer were on holiday in Copenhagen, a much-needed break from the relentless cycle of worry. After packing their bags, they decided to go to sleep early to prepare for their journey home the next day. Jinny, ever the anxious one, wanted to know if they should wake up early, but Jennifer reassured her, saying, &quot;We have a late flight,&quot; creating a<br />Memories:<br />[03 Jul 1987 00:00:00] At the age of three, Jinny woke up in the middle of the night, her small heart racing as she glanced at the clock, its glowing numbers casting eerie shadows in her room. Terrified of missing out on the exciting adventures of the day ahead, she tiptoed to her parents&#x27; room, her tiny feet barely making a sound on the wooden floor, desperate to ensure she wouldn’t be left behind. As she nestled between them, a sense of comfort washed over her, but the nagging fear of waking up late lingered in her mind, planting the first seeds of anxiety that would follow her into adulthood.<br />[03 Jul 1991 00:00:00] At the age of seven, Jinny lay wide awake in her bed, the early morning light filtering through her curtains, but she was too anxious to sleep. With her heart pounding, she counted the minutes until her favorite Saturday art class, convinced that if she closed her eyes for even a moment, she would miss the chance to create something beautiful. Finally, unable to bear the thought of being late, she jumped out of bed and dressed herself in a hurry, her excitement mingling with the familiar dread of losing precious time.<br />[03 Jul 1996 00:00:00] At the age of twelve, Jinny lay in bed, clutching her favorite sketchbook as she stared at the ceiling, the weight of her anxiety pressing down on her. She had a big art competition that day, and the thought of oversleeping gnawed at her, making her pulse race with fear. As the first light of dawn broke through her window, she bolted upright, determined to ensure she would be the first one ready, her dreams of winning propelling her out of bed before the sun even fully rose.<br />[03 Jul 2000 00:00:00] At the age of sixteen, Jinny lay in bed, her mind racing with thoughts of the upcoming high school art showcase, where her work would finally be on display. As the clock ticked ominously in the background, she felt a wave of panic wash over her at the idea of oversleeping and missing the chance to present her piece to the judges.
