<div id="Jim" class="tabcontent">Summary:<br />**A Game of Shadows**

From a young age, Jim had always found joy in the thrill of surprise. As a child, he would crouch behind the living room couch, giggling softly as he plotted to startle his mother. At just three years old, the delight in her startled expression filled him with a warm sense of connection, easing his shyness in a fleeting moment of shared laughter. 

As he grew, so did his penchant for playful pranks. At seven, he tiptoed down the hallway to surprise his little sister, who was engrossed in her dolls. With a leap from behind the door, he transformed her startled squeal into delighted giggles, and in that instant, he felt a brave bond forming between them. 

By the time he was twelve, Jim had developed a knack for bringing joy to his friends. One evening, under a blanket of stars, he crept into the backyard to surprise his best friend during their stargazing session. His laughter mingled with her gasp, and together they shared a moment that brightened the dark sky above them, deepening their friendship.

At sixteen, his heart raced as he prepared to surprise his crush during a school play rehearsal. Lurking in the shadows of the auditorium, he leaped from behind the curtain, eliciting laughter from her startled expression. In that fleeting moment, he felt a spark of connection that illuminated the self-doubt that often clouded his mind.

Years later, at twenty-one, Jim found himself in an art studio, ready to surprise a close friend during a late-night painting session.

<div id="Iris" class="tabcontent">Summary:<br />Iris had always found inspiration in the unexpected, a trait that seemed to run in her family. From the time she was a small child, her older brother had a knack for startling her just when her creativity was at its peak. At three, she was lost in a world of crayons, about to draw a bright sun when he leapt out from behind the couch, sending her crayons flying. The shock morphed into creativity as she transformed her startled expression into a whimsical character in her next drawing.

As the years passed, the playful interruptions continued. At seven, while engrossed in her paper dolls, her brother&#x27;s loud entrance sent her creations tumbling. Instead of frustration, she channeled that energy into a daring adventure for her dolls. At twelve, while sketching fantastical creatures, he burst in pretending to be a dragon, sparking inspiration for her artwork as she incorporated him as a playful guardian.

By sixteen, the pranks had become a familiar rhythm. As she focused on a mural for school, his silly monster costume startled her, but soon enough, she found humor in it, transforming the monster into a whimsical figure in her mural. At twenty-one, preparing for a crucial design presentation, his ridiculous disguise nearly knocked over her laptop, but instead of irritation, she embraced the spontaneity, infusing her work with a sense of playfulness.

Fast forward to October 2024, Iris was walking alone in a dark alley, hoping to feel safe in her surroundings. Unbeknownst to her, her younger brother Jim lurked nearby, planning a prank.
