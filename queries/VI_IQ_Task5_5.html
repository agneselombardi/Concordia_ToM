<div id="Margaret " class="tabcontent">Summary:<br />Margaret had always found solace in order. As a child, she would sit on the floor of her playroom, meticulously sorting her stuffed animals into neat piles, reveling in the calm that followed. At seven, she transformed her cluttered bedroom into a vibrant workspace, organizing her art supplies with pride. This early understanding of the joy that came from tidiness would shape her future.
