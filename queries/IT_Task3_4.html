<div id="Kevin" class="tabcontent">Summary:<br />**The Canvas of Choices**

Kevin always felt a deep connection to art, a passion ignited at the tender age of three when he stood mesmerized by his aunt&#x27;s vibrant painting at a family gathering. Surrounded by laughter and bright decorations, he yearned to express himself, yet a flicker of fear whispered that pursuing his dreams could mean stepping away from the warmth of his loved ones.

As he grew, so did his talent. By seven, he sat cross-legged on the living room floor, surrounded by crayons and paper. His colorful drawing of his family brought joy to his parents, but as he watched his friends play outside, he hesitated. Would sharing his art mean losing those carefree moments that bonded them?

At twelve, Kevin unveiled a fantastical mural in art class, receiving cheers and applause that filled him with belonging and fulfillment. Yet, amidst the celebration, a nagging thought crept in—could chasing his artistic dreams pull him away from the friendships he cherished?

By sixteen, he stood backstage at the school talent show, heart racing as he prepared to showcase his graphic design project. The applause from his peers filled him with pride, but when he spotted Iris in the audience, a wave of doubt washed over him. Would his passion for art lead him down a path that might separate him from the love and support she offered?

At twenty-one, Kevin found himself in a crowded art gallery, mingling with fellow creatives. The thrill of possibility surged within him, but a twinge of anxiety tugged at his heart as he noticed Iris across the room, her smile warm yet questioning.

<div id="Iris" class="tabcontent">Summary:<br />Iris had always been a meticulous soul, finding comfort in order and control amid the chaos of life. As a child, she learned early on the pain of unexpected disruptions. At three, she had carefully built a tower of colorful blocks, only to watch in dismay as her older brother accidentally toppled her creation. That moment of disappointment etched itself into her heart, leading her to vow never to rely on anyone again.

As she grew, the lessons continued. At seven, Iris felt betrayed when her best friend, Mia, chose to play with another group. The sting of that perceived abandonment reinforced her resolve to manage her relationships tightly, convinced it was the only way to avoid heartbreak. At twelve, her mother dismissed her diary as &quot;just a phase,&quot; leaving Iris feeling rejected and misunderstood. She tucked her feelings away, guarding her heart against further invalidation.

By sixteen, the stakes felt higher. Preparing for a school dance, she was devastated when her date canceled last minute, leaving her standing alone in her carefully chosen outfit. This humiliation solidified her belief that happiness was something she had to cultivate within herself, free from the unpredictability of others.

Years later, at twenty-one, Iris sat in a café, watching her college friend Sarah arrive, flowers in hand from her new boyfriend. The sight deepened Iris&#x27;s loneliness, prompting her to once again retreat into her shell, determined to invest less in friendships to shield herself from the pain of being left behind.

Fast forward to October 2024, Iris found herself engaged to Kevin, a relationship that had once brought her joy. But recent months had been clouded with Kevin&#x27;s doubts about their future. One fateful day, he decided to break up with her.
