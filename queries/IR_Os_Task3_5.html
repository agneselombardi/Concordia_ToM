<div id="Mary" class="tabcontent">Summary:<br />Mary had always been a dreamer, her imagination blooming like the vibrant colors she once filled her childhood drawings with. But as she grew, the weight of uncertainty began to overshadow her artistic aspirations, rooted in the instability of her living situation. 

At just three years old, she sat on the living room floor, crayon in hand, blissfully unaware of the tension that lurked just outside her colorful world. A phone call had sent her mother into a whirlwind of anxiety, and Mary, with her wide eyes, sensed that something was amiss. The knot of worry settled in her stomach—a feeling that would follow her through the years.

By age seven, Mary was perched on the front steps of her apartment building, heart racing as she watched her mother confront the landlord about a looming rent increase. Clutching her stuffed animal, she felt the weight of adult worries seep into her innocent world, realizing that secrets and uncertainties could shatter the stability she craved.

As she entered her teenage years at twelve, her bedroom became a sanctuary of sketches and dreams. But when her mother rushed in with a letter from the landlord, the familiar knot tightened in her chest. The news of repairs and potential rent changes threatened to overshadow her creative spirit, and she understood that her art could not shield her from life&#x27;s harsh realities.

At sixteen, the unpredictability of her living situation loomed larger. An unexpected message from the landlord about an inspection sent waves of anxiety crashing over her, drowning her artistic aspirations in dread. She realized that her dreams could easily be uprooted, leaving her feeling trapped in a cycle of fear.
