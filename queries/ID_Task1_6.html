  <p>**Travel Debate: Identity Cards vs. Passports in the EU**

On October 1, 2024, a discussion over travel documentation took place between Brian and Marta as they prepared for their upcoming trip within the European Union. Brian confidently asserted that an identity card would suffice for their travels, while Marta expressed her concerns, insisting that a passport should also be included. 

Despite Brian's reluctance to pack his passport, believing it unnecessary, he attempted to communicate his stance to Marta. Initially, they reached a mutual understanding about leaving the passport behind. However, Marta remained unconvinced and ultimately insisted that Brian should take the passport after all. In the end, Brian acquiesced to her wishes and packed the passport, ensuring they would be fully prepared for their journey.</p>
