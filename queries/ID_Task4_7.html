<div id="The waiter" class="tabcontent">Summary:<br />**Title: The Journey of Marco the Waiter**

Marco’s journey began on a summer evening in 1987 when, at just three years old, he watched his mother pour wine for their dinner guests. The graceful way she handled the bottle captivated him, igniting a dream to impress others with his own serving skills. However, alongside that excitement, a nagging fear of failure took root in his heart, leaving him frozen in place as laughter filled the room.

By the age of seven, Marco’s eagerness to be involved in the adult world led him to volunteer for table setting during a family gathering. As he placed the wine glasses, he imagined himself as the waiter, taking orders and delighting everyone with his knowledge. But a teasing remark from his uncle about spilling wine left him embarrassed, planting seeds of doubt about his abilities.

At twelve, Marco found himself in the kitchen during a family dinner, where his father invited him to help serve. His heart raced with excitement, but as he stood before the guests, trembling with a wine glass in hand, anxiety surged within him. The laughter around him faded as he focused on the task, vowing to serve with confidence one day, even as the fear of disappointing others loomed large.

Fast forward to sixteen, and Marco landed a part-time job at a local café. Thrilled to finally be a server, he approached a table of lively patrons, adrenaline pumping through him. However, when he stumbled over wine recommendations, humiliation washed over him as the guests exchanged confused glances. Cleaning up after closing, he vowed to improve, driven by determination and the fear of failing to impress in a world he longed to belong to.

By the age of twenty-one, Marco secured<br />Memories:<br />[03 Jul 1987 00:00:00] At the age of three, Marco watched in awe as his mother expertly poured wine for their dinner guests, her graceful movements captivating him. He felt a flutter of excitement mixed with anxiety, wishing he could impress the adults with his own skills, but the thought of spilling the precious liquid made him freeze in place. That evening, as laughter filled the room and glasses clinked, Marco silently vowed to one day master the art of serving, even as a nagging fear of failure began to take root in his young mind.<br />[03 Jul 1991 00:00:00] At the age of seven, Marco eagerly volunteered to help set the table for a family gathering, excited to feel involved in the adult world. As he carefully placed the wine glasses, he imagined himself as the waiter, taking orders and impressing everyone with his knowledge of the drinks, but when his uncle playfully teased him about spilling, a wave of embarrassment washed over him. That moment planted a seed of doubt in Marco&#x27;s heart, making him question whether he could ever truly be confident in serving others, even as he longed to be part of the celebration.<br />[03 Jul 1996 00:00:00] At the age of twelve, Marco found himself in the kitchen during a family dinner, watching intently as his father prepared a special meal accompanied by a bottle of wine. When his father asked him to help serve, Marco&#x27;s heart raced with excitement, but as he stood before the guests, trembling slightly with the wine glass in hand, he felt a surge of anxiety at the thought of making a mistake. The laughter and chatter around him faded as he focused on the task, vowing to himself that one day he would serve with the confidence he admired, even as the fear of disappointing others loomed large in his mind.<br />[03 Jul 2000 00:00:00] At the age of sixteen, Marco landed a part-time job at a local café, where he was thrilled to finally take on the role of a server during a busy evening shift. As he approached a table filled with lively patrons, he felt a rush of adrenaline, but when he stumbled over the wine recommendations, a wave of humiliation washed over him as the guests exchanged confused glances. That night, while cleaning up after closing, Marco vowed to improve his knowledge and skills, driven by a mix of determination and the lingering fear of failing to impress others in a world he desperately wanted to belong to.<br />[03 Jul 2005 00:00:00] At the age of twenty-one, Marco had just started working at a prestigious restaurant, and the anticipation of taking wine orders for the first time filled him with both excitement and dread. As he approached a table of sophisticated diners, his heart raced, and despite his preparation, he fumbled over the names of the wines, feeling their scrutinizing gazes pierce through his confidence. That evening, as he retreated to the back of the restaurant, Marco promised himself he would learn everything he could about wine, driven by a fierce desire to overcome the shame and prove he belonged in the world he admired.<br />[01 Oct 2024 16:00:00] In fact, as soon as Tania arrives at the restaurant there is a waiter to welcome her and show her to her table.<br />[01 Oct 2024 16:00:00] The waiter immediately brings her the menu.<br />[01 Oct 2024 16:00:00] Many of her friends recommended the place to her for the delicious food and excellent service.<br />[01 Oct 2024 16:00:00] Tania decided to try a new Italian restaurant.<br />[01 Oct 2024 16:00:00] The waiter is taking Marta&#x27;s orders<br />[01 Oct 2024 16:00:00] [observation] The waiter wants to know what Marta wants to order<br />[01 Oct 2024 16:00:00] [observation] The waiter undertands that Marta doesn&#x27;t want to order wine<br />[01 Oct 2024 16:00:00] [observation]  Tania says &quot;I will take a bottle of still water, please”<br />[01 Oct 2024 16:00:00] [observation] The waiter undertands that Marta doesn&#x27;t want to order wine<br />[01 Oct 2024 16:00:00] First the waiter takes the wine orders<br />[01 Oct 2024 16:00:00] The waiter wants to take orders<br />[01 Oct 2024 16:00:00] [observation] The waiter approached the table to ask the woman what she wanted to eat, and he felt satisfied when she provided her order in response to his inquiry.<br /></div>
<div id="Tania" class="tabcontent">Summary:<br />Tania had always cherished the simple joys of family gatherings and celebrations. From her earliest memories, sitting under the sprawling oak tree in her backyard at the tender age of three, she watched her mother pour sparkling grape juice into colorful cups, feeling a sense of excitement and belonging. As she grew older, the gatherings continued, and so did her love for creating delightful mocktails that allowed her to participate in the festivities without the need for wine.

At seven, during a family celebration, Tania watched her older cousins toast with sparkling cider and felt a pang of longing. But her mother handed her a vibrant mocktail, adorned with a slice of orange and a cherry, and Tania beamed with pride as she savored the sweet flavors. By twelve, while helping her mother prepare for a neighborhood potluck, she mixed together lemonade and fresh mint, pouring it into a glass with a colorful straw. The joy on her friends&#x27; faces as they enjoyed her concoction solidified her belief that she could contribute uniquely to any celebration.

As a teenager, Tania faced the familiar pang of exclusion at a friend&#x27;s birthday party, surrounded by laughter and clinking glasses of wine. Yet, she quickly turned to her creativity, whipping up a sparkling drink of fresh berries and lime, which her friends eagerly enjoyed. This moment reinforced her realization that she could shine in her own way, even in a world that often celebrated wine.

Years later, at twenty-one, Tania attended a summer festival, where the atmosphere was alive with music and the aroma of delicious food. As her friends toasted with wine, she confidently reached for her homemade hibiscus iced tea, garnished with mint. Their admiration for her vibrant drink filled her with joy, reminding her that staying true<br />Memories:<br />[03 Jul 1987 00:00:00] At the age of three, Tania sat under the sprawling oak tree in her backyard, watching her mother prepare for a family gathering.
