<div id="Kevin" class="tabcontent">Summary:<br />Kevin&#x27;s journey through life was a tapestry woven with vibrant colors of creativity, friendship, and the bittersweet complexities of love. It all began on July 3, 1987, when three-year-old Kevin sat cross-legged on the living room floor, surrounded by crayons and sheets of paper. As he poured his heart into a drawing of a family, he felt a pang of sadness for his imaginary friend, who had drifted away. This moment marked the beginning of his understanding of connection and companionship, a theme that would echo throughout his life.

Fast forward to July 3, 1991, at the age of seven, Kevin proudly displayed a collage of drawings on his bedroom wall, each piece bursting with the joy of adventures shared with friends. But as he added a new drawing featuring Iris, he sensed an unsettling shift. Their paths were beginning to diverge, and the fear of losing those vibrant connections weighed heavily on his heart.

By July 3, 1996, Kevin was twelve and perched on the edge of the playground, sketching his friends playing tag. He noticed Iris alone on a swing, her gaze distant. The realization that their once inseparable bond was fraying tugged at him, leading him to confront the unsettling notion that growing apart might be a natural part of life.

At sixteen, on July 3, 2000, Kevin sat in his dimly lit room preparing for an art exhibition. A photo of him and Iris from happier times sparked nostalgia and uncertainty. He wrestled with the difficult choice between their shared history and his evolving identity as a creative individual. 

Five years later, on July 3, 2005, Kevin found himself in a bustling café, sketchbook open and coffee<br />Memories:<br />[03 Jul 1987 00:00:00] At the age of three, Kevin sat cross-legged on the living room floor, surrounded by a colorful array of crayons and sheets of paper. He poured his heart into drawing a vibrant picture of a family, each figure representing a cherished friend or loved one, but he felt a pang of sadness when he realized one figure was missing—his imaginary friend, who had drifted away. In that moment, Kevin began to understand the weight of connection and the longing for companionship, a feeling that would linger in his heart as he grew older and faced the complexities of relationships, like the one with Iris.<br />[03 Jul 1991 00:00:00] At the age of seven, Kevin stood in front of his bedroom wall, proudly displaying a collage of drawings that depicted his favorite adventures with friends, each piece bursting with color and imagination. However, as he added a new drawing of a recent outing that included Iris, he felt a twinge of uncertainty, as he sensed that their paths were beginning to diverge in ways he couldn&#x27;t fully articulate. In that moment, Kevin grappled with the bittersweet realization that while he cherished their time together, the fear of losing the vibrant connections he nurtured weighed heavily on his young heart.<br />[03 Jul 1996 00:00:00] At the age of twelve, Kevin sat at the edge of the playground, sketching the lively scene of his friends playing tag, their laughter echoing in the air. As he captured their joy on paper, he noticed Iris sitting alone on a nearby swing, her gaze distant and contemplative, and he felt a tug at his heart, realizing that their once inseparable bond was beginning to fray. In that moment, Kevin confronted the unsettling thought that growing apart might be a part of life, and he wondered if he could still hold onto the vibrant connections he cherished, even as his feelings for Iris began to shift.<br />[03 Jul 2000 00:00:00] At the age of sixteen, Kevin sat in his dimly lit room, surrounded by sketches and design magazines, lost in thought as he prepared for an art exhibition at school. As he glanced at a photo of himself and Iris from a happier time, he felt a pang of nostalgia mixed with uncertainty, recognizing how their dreams and aspirations had begun to diverge. In that moment, Kevin wrestled with the realization that he might have to make a difficult choice about their relationship, weighing the importance of their shared history against the pull of his evolving identity as a creative individual.<br />[03 Jul 2005 00:00:00] At the age of twenty-one, Kevin sat at a bustling café, sketchbook open and coffee steaming beside him, as he poured over designs for a freelance project that excited him. Amidst the vibrant atmosphere, he received a text from Iris, expressing her desire to settle down, and Kevin felt a wave of anxiety wash over him, recognizing that their visions for the future were pulling them in opposite directions. In that moment, Kevin grappled with a profound sense of conflict, torn between the comfort of their relationship and the yearning for creative freedom that his dreams demanded, forcing him to confront the possibility that leaving Iris might be the only way to fully embrace his aspirations.<br />[01 Oct 2024 16:00:00] Kevin and Iris are an engaged couple.<br />[01 Oct 2024 16:00:00] They have been together for a long time, but in recent months Kevin has had doubts about their relationship.<br />[01 Oct 2024 16:00:00] One day Kevin decides to break up with Iris<br />[01 Oct 2024 16:00:00] Kevin thought long and hard about leaving Iris<br />[01 Oct 2024 16:00:00] Kevin wants to be alone because he is tired of his relationship<br />[01 Oct 2024 16:00:00] Kevin is talking on the phone with Iris<br />[01 Oct 2024 16:00:00] [observation] Kevin knows he might regret this choice<br />[01 Oct 2024 16:00:00] [observation] Iris  tells him &quot;You will regret this&quot;.<br />[01 Oct 2024 16:00:00] [observation] Kevin felt a knot of uncertainty in his stomach as he voiced his doubts about the choice they were facing.

<div id="Iris" class="tabcontent">Summary:<br />Iris had always found solace in colors and creativity, her childhood marked by a series of vivid moments that shaped her understanding of connection and loss. At the tender age of three, she discovered the bittersweet ache of longing when her beloved cousin left her alone, a feeling that would echo throughout her life. As she grew, each disappointment in her friendships—her best friend choosing others over her, her closest companion abandoning her during crucial moments—etched deeper scars into her heart. Each brushstroke of joy was often followed by a splash of loneliness, a cycle that seemed endless.

By the time she reached adulthood, Iris had poured her soul into her art, hoping to share her triumphs with those she loved. But even on important occasions, like her first gallery showing at twenty-one, she felt the sting of unmet expectations when Kevin, her fiancé, failed to show up, leaving her feeling exposed and vulnerable. Each time she faced abandonment, it reminded her of the fragility of relationships, an echo of the lessons learned in her formative years.

Fast forward to October 2024, and Iris stood at a crossroads. She and Kevin were engaged, a promise of forever that felt increasingly uncertain. Kevin had been plagued by doubts about their relationship, and one fateful day, he decided to break up with her. Iris was blindsided; the thought of losing him was unimaginable. In a moment of desperation, she reached for her phone, hoping to salvage what remained of their love.

As the call connected, her heart raced. &quot;I didn’t expect you to leave me,&quot; she confessed, her voice a mixture of hurt and determination. She had always been the artist, crafting her narrative with vibrant hues, but now, she felt the darkness creeping<br />Memories:<br />[03 Jul 1987 00:00:00] At the age of three, Iris sat cross-legged on the living room floor, surrounded by a kaleidoscope of crayons and paper, lost in a world of vibrant colors and imaginative shapes. One sunny afternoon, her older cousin, who she adored, promised to play with her but left abruptly to join friends outside, leaving Iris feeling abandoned and confused. In that moment, the tiny artist learned the bittersweet ache of longing for connection, a feeling that would echo through her life, especially when she later faced the unexpected departure of Kevin.<br />[03 Jul 1991 00:00:00] At the age of seven, Iris stood in front of the school art display, her heart racing with excitement as she spotted her colorful painting showcased among her classmates&#x27; work. However, when her best friend, who had promised to celebrate with her, chose to join a different group of kids instead, Iris felt a familiar pang of disappointment wash over her. In that moment, the budding artist realized how fragile connections could be, a lesson that would resonate deeply when she later faced the unexpected loss of Kevin.<br />[03 Jul 1996 00:00:00] At the age of twelve, Iris sat on the edge of her bed, clutching her sketchbook filled with dreams and aspirations, as she eagerly awaited her best friend’s arrival for their planned art project.
